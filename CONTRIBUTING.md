## Pull Requests

Send pull requests to this repository in GitHub.

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - Fix the code style with `composer cs`.

- **Add tests/specs!** - Pull requests will not be merged when the code coverage will not be increased by merging it.

- **Document changes** - Add a changelog in the Pull Request description in [this format](http://keepachangelog.com).

- **Try not to break functionality**. We follow [semver](http://semver.org), so breaking changes require new major version numbers.

- **Create branches per pull request** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **Atomic commits**. For a code style change: create a different commit. For every functional change: create a different pull request.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

## Running Tests

$ composer test

**Happy coding**!
